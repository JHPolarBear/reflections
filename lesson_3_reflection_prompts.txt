When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - if I have to work with other colleagues, or I worked on various computers, I have to manage my
    project online. and remote repository like github will be the best choice for it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- Because if other person worked on same file which what I am working on and Github 
	  update the file automatically, I can lose my work I did before update.
	  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - fork copy the repository within Github, wihle clone copy the repository in Github to local github
	  or copy repository from local to local. branch can copy commit in a repository to make other version 
	  for commit to test or other works.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If we can get the state of the remote stored locally, we can compare whether github remote
	is changed and update the state if we want. by this, we can synchronize local and remote 
	anytime we want

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    we can copy the whole project folder and share with other teammate. if the project scale is small and 
	not need much combination, it could be easy way to collaborate. but if the porject scale becomes bigger,
	sharing whole files will take a lot of time to share new version and combine whole division

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    if we test new feature or trying to fix the bugs, doing it on master branch can produce another problems,
	or bugs. branch provide space to test new things without mass up original code.
